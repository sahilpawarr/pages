Hey, I am Sahil!

I currently work as a Project Manager at[ Global Action for Policy Lab]([url](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/gap/)) at [Northeastern]([url](https://www.northeastern.edu/)), where I lead projects in APAC aimed at economic development through research and analysis. Previously, I worked as an Associate at the CEO's Office at [Cambridge Wealth]([url](https://www.cambridgewealth.in/)) - an early-stage fintech startup focused on the wealth management space. I hold a degree in economics from the [Gokhale Insitute of Politics and Economics]([url](https://gipe.ac.in/)) in Pune. While at university, I interned with research institutions such as [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability]([url](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)), [Policy Research Organisation]([url](https://www.policyresearch.in/)) and technology startups including [Moonraft Innovation Labs]([url](https://moonraft.com/)) and [Evolve Inc]([url](https://evolveinc.io/)).

My interests include largely everything related to economics - but more specifically I care deeply for areas revolving around macroeconomics, financial markets, decarbonisation and machine learning. 

I am passively curious about practically everything that I wish to find answers to. Iâ€™ve always said my perfect career would be whatever pays me to just learn everything all the time for no specific reason. like a scholar for hire. You can find my [long form writings here](https://sahilpawar.substack.com/)

Apart from all this, I enjoy playing football, listening to metal music and am deeply passionate about traveling with the sole purpose of eating.

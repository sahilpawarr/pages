Hey, I am Sahil!

I currently work as a Project Manager at Global Action for Policy Lab at Northeastern, where I lead projects in APAC aimed at economic development through research and analysis. Previously, I worked as an Associate at the CEO's Office at Cambridge Wealth - an early-stage fintech startup focused in the wealth management space. I hold a degree in economics from the Gokhale Insitute of Politics and Economics in Pune. While at university, I interned with research institutions such as Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, Policy Research Organisation and technology startups including Moonraft Innovation Labs and Evolve Inc.

My interests include largely everything related to economics - but more specifically I care deeply for areas revolving around macroeconomics, financial markets, decarbonisation and machine learning. 

Apart from all this, I enjoy playing football, listening to metal music and am deeply passionate about traveling with the sole purpose of eating.
